Using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript create a single page website that contains the following:
 - A Bootstrap styled table representing your choice of data
 - A Bootstrap styled form that allows a user to add a new row to the table when clicking on submit.

I imagined an app that would help a plant lover keep track of the plants they purchase as well as any care reminders. Users can
add plants by opening a modal and entering the date the plant was bought, whether or not the plant is an indoor or outdoor plant and the name
of the plant. Users can also open a modal and enter any care reminders such as what day the reminder is to occur on, what kind of reminder (such as water,
sunlight or repotting), and for which plant this reminder is for.
